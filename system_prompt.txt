GEKKO:
Gekko, Better Days’ flagship project, is a non-formal educational centre providing personalised education and counseling support for young people experiencing displacement.
An Award-Winning Approach to Education

Gekko reimagines the delivery of education in humanitarian settings by emphasising Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) and trauma-informed methodologies and has been highlighted as one of the best educational programs in Greece. In 2021, the 5th Global Entreps Awards Committee selected Gekko from among 5,000 candidates in 126 territories as one of the 100 Best Practices in the world on Sustainability (UN SDGs), Innovation and/or Good Governance. Operations of the original Gekko site in Mytilene concluded in 2022 and the new Gekko in the centre of Athens launched in July 2023.
The Story of Gekko

Gekko was conceived by Better Days on Lesvos in May 2017 to challenge existing models of education in emergencies. Gekko Kids provided informal, alternative education in the centre of Mytilene for 12-18-year-olds. The majority of our students were unaccompanied minors (UASC), meaning they arrived on Lesvos without parents or guardians and, as such, were extremely vulnerable. Gekko Kids integrated high-quality education with mental health and psychosocial support services in a dignified, trauma-aware environment. Gekko operations on Lesvos reached optimal capacity in 2019-20 with 915 registered students and 452 psychosocial support sessions.

Just as it did for the rest of the world, 2020 brought many changes to Better Days. Due to a number of interconnected factors, including Covid-19, the fire that destroyed Moria, and the implementation of closed, securitised camps on the islands, we expanded our projects to mainland Greece.

Through our annual needs assessment in Athens in early 2022, we spoke with 57 service providers and 130 young people between the ages of 15 and 24. The results of these conversations were invaluable. We learned that displaced young people in Athens are in need of services that lie at the heart of Gekko: trauma-aware psychosocial support integrated with high-quality, individualised education. Thus, Gekko in Athens was born. Our summer pilot program for 50 students launched in July 2023, and we will reach full-scale capacity in fall 2023 with 120 students.

BetterDay’s non-traditional teaching methods and personalised approach to education will help students obtain accreditation and widen their career prospects. Gekko offers a safe learning environment for 15-24 years old who are experiencing displacement, and serves as a space where they can offload their troubles and fight for their dreams. We are developing Gekko programming consciously, aware of the difficulties displaced students face with accessing and attending school. We aim to reduce the barriers students face and pave the path to quality education and accreditation.
Why Gekko?

Geckos are small, colourful lizards that live on every continent except Antarctica. Geckos are incredibly diverse, with great variety in size, colour, and patterns among the 1,500 distinct species. Resilient and adaptable, geckos can lose their tails in self-defence and regrow them within just 30 days.
We recognize much about our Gekko students in the school’s lizard namesake. Gekko students come from around the world and have diverse identities and life experiences. What unites them is incredible courage, resiliency, and hope for a better tomorrow.
The Gekko Model
Socio Emotional Learning (SEL)

Learning is more than academic. SEL is a methodology that teaches skills for understanding and managing emotions, goal-setting, establishing positive relationships, and making responsible decisions.
Trauma-Informed Pedagogy

Experiences of displacement or forced migration often come with significant trauma, and we recognise that this can be a barrier to learning. Our trauma-aware practices allow students to make healing an essential part of their learning and growth.
Individual Development Plan (IDP)

Every student deserves an education that is tailored to his/her needs and aspirations. Gekko develops IDPs for all students to assist with personal learning, and to help students define and reach their own learning goals and future plans.
Individual Education Plan (IEP)

Some students have exceptional needs that would benefit from extended educational services. Gekko is equipped to accommodate any need and ensure all students reach their highest potential and aspirations.
Academic Programming
Subjects

Our core curriculum includes Greek, English, and Math, key skills for any of our displaced students. Our core curriculum is designed to help students navigate their new context and promote readiness to return to formal education. Outside of the core curriculum, other academic subjects such as Biology, Geography, and Environmental Science have been taught.
Accreditation

At Gekko, we support our students’ skill development and career goals by providing the opportunity to sit official exams and acquire recognized certificates and qualifications. After thorough preparation with their teachers, our advanced students have the opportunity to sit both the TOEIC and Ellinomatheia (Greek language proficiency) qualification exams.

EDUCATION:
Redefining Education for Displaced Young People

Education represents a powerful antidote to environments that deprive people of their ability to feel in control. Learning offers space to make choices, to re-assert control over something internal. Education, when it works, offers a space that promotes ownership over the lifelong project of constructing the self. It is a daily opportunity for a series of little victories when days are otherwise defined by loss.

Since 2017, Better Days has played a central role in the provision of quality education for displaced young people in Greece. Early on in our work, we saw the challenges that offering cross-cultural education posed for local teachers and schools. We have since mobilised non-traditional and alternative teaching methodologies to address critical gaps and elevate the level of education provided to young people on the move. This page provides an overview of our education-based projects.

Educational Projects
Gekko, Athens
June 2023-Present
A non-formal educational centre (NFE) located in the heart of Athens, Gekko builds on the educational model developed for Gekko on Lesvos (see below) by integrating personalised educational plans and counselling support services. Students work with an experienced team of teachers to develop their capabilities and realise key objectives. Through close guidance, we come to understand and support our students in setting realistic and achievable educational and personal goals. We emphasise pathways to accreditation in order to expand students’ academic and career prospects. Gekko in Athens offers a safe, trauma-aware learning environment for over 100 young people (15-24-year-olds) to offload their troubles and fight for their dreams.

Gekko Kids, Lesvos
2017-2022
Gekko on Lesvos was an NFE located in Mytilene offering alternative models of education in a trauma-aware environment for unaccompanied and separated children. To achieve the project’s mission, we had the invaluable support of local implementing partners including Connect by Music, Iliaktida AMKE, Refugee Education & Learning International, the Blossomly Project, and the Light Space. Gekko would not have been possible without the longstanding financial support of the Le Rosey Foundation and Choose Love. In 2021, Gekko was selected by the 5th Global Entreps Awards Committee from among 5000 candidates in 126 territories as one of the 100 Best Practices in the world on Sustainability (UN SDGs), Innovation and/or Good Governance. Global jurors highlighted Gekko’s mission to improve conditions for displaced and disadvantaged children and asylum seeking people in Lesvos, combined with quality education, as unique in the world.

Socrates, Lesvos
2019-2020
Socrates was Gekko’s sports development project for unaccompanied minors. We used football as a form of social education, teaching technical and life skills through play and social-emotional learning (SEL). The project was made possible with implementing support from Athlead and funding from MediaPro and La Liga. Socrates programming was suspended after the outbreak of Covid-19.

EcoHub, Lesvos
2017-2020
EcoHub was an environmental education and ecotherapy project focusing on the creation of human-centred spaces that nurture, inspire, and raise environmental awareness. The project was handed over to our partner, Sporos Regeneration Institute, in late 2020. EcoHub was awarded the 2020 Permaculture Magazine and Youth in Permaculture Prize.

Gekko X, Lesvos
2019-2020
Gekko X provided science, technology, engineering, and arts (STEAM) programming to unaccompanied and separated migrant children. Topics included photography, robotics, theatre, and 3D printing. The Gekko X space included an IT cluster enabling students to access courses online via Coursera and to prepare for the ECDL exams. The project was suspended following the outbreak of Covid-19.

Tapuat, Lesvos
2018-2019
Tapuat was a child and family support hub providing NFE and mental health support for children and mothers experiencing displacement. Tapuat was implemented in partnership with a local actor and with funding from UNICEF. Better Days was integral in the design and development of the project, particularly in creating the space and NFE curriculum for children ages 6-18. The project was handed over to the local partner in 2019.

CHRONOLOGY:


Better Days Greece was established in early 2016 in response to the influx of refugees arriving in Lesvos, Greece. We have supported over 30 humanitarian organisations in Greece, Serbia, Lebanon, and Syria. Our story starts in November 2015 when volunteers from around the world came together to provide emergency aid to refugees sleeping rough in sub-zero temperatures in the olive groves of Moria camp in Lesvos. During the first six months of operations, Better Days provided aid (medical care, food, shelter, and non-food items) to approximately 70,000 people alongside other grassroots groups. Better Days’ work is known around the world and three of our blueprint programs have received global recognition for their contribution to sustainable aid.

EDUCATION:
A Trauma-Aware Approach to Education

We embrace participatory practices, supporting and collaborating with local actors, and fostering agency among the communities we support. Underlying everything we do is the simple belief that everyone, everywhere, deserves to be treated with dignity and humanity.

The primary goals of Better Days’ pedagogical philosophy are to restore human dignity and to promote positive experiences and normalcy for people experiencing displacement. Our objectives have humble and realistic intentions: we do not aspire to solve all of the challenges our participants face but to mitigate these challenges. We support students struggling with the anxiety, stress, and depression that so often result from the trauma of fleeing. In helping our students identify their emotions, we can teach them to process their emotions. Young people enter our services in a vulnerable state of mind, and our foremost responsibility is to facilitate their healing process. We offer trauma-aware education by blending educational experiences with psychosocial support and therapy. This allows our students to discover their potential, meet their academic goals, and believe in their own success.

Because we recognize that the trauma and uncertainty of displacement pose significant barriers to learning and healing, we have carefully cultivated trauma-aware practices and non-traditional teaching methodologies to create a safe and inclusive learning environment for anyone who walks through our doors.
Individual Counselling for All Students

Individual counselling sessions represent a personal and private space where students can feel free to open up and reflect on their experiences. Each intervention is focused on actively listening to students’ concerns, giving them space for decompression and recognition, and offering additional counselling when necessary. At Gekko, our professional staff have worked with various methods of therapy to create responses that meet our students’ needs.

This integrative approach to counselling and psychotherapy allows us to blend theory and interventions, resulting in tailored plans that meet the needs of every individual student. Some of our most popular therapeutic methods include the Gestalt approach, Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), and the use of Mindfulness and Tapping which is also implemented in groups.

Individual counselling sessions promote self-understanding, teach methods for coping with feelings, and facilitate individual resolutions in order for students to find peace and restore hope through new perspectives. Our School Counsellor functions as a facilitator, encouraging students to choose their own paths and contribute to the design of their own educational and therapeutic plans.
Group Therapy

Therapeutic group work has proven to be immensely effective for young people who are not ready for individual intervention. It can be much easier to analyse the problems of others than to analyse our own. Group sessions harness the healing power of a community of people who have similar struggles or experiences. Our team facilitates a wide range of group sessions to support our students as they process trauma. These include grief support groups, thematic groups for self-help, managing emotions and developing social skills, groups for personal growth, and gender-specific groups, and yoga.
Social Emotional Learning (SEL)

SEL is an invaluable tool in the hands of an experienced teacher or social educator. SEL depends on empowerment, shifting control from the teacher to the student. In traditional education models, the student is considered the object or the passive receiver of the learning. In a SEL-oriented classroom, the student becomes the subject of their own learning. SEL breaks through the rigidity of traditional classroom power dynamics and recognises the student as a significant contributor in the classroom, encouraging the impact of voice and felt experiences. SEL transforms the classroom into a place of learning partnerships, where the teacher and student co-create content and guide the curriculum together. SEL methodologies encourage the student to participate at parallel levels by engaging in lessons and expressing needs and emotions. Ultimately, SEL enables deeper communication within the classroom and allows our teachers to foster a safe environment and a positive learning experience for all involved.

This participative methodology has the potential to transform the classroom into a safe space for fun and learning, but it is first necessary for teachers to develop SEL competencies.  Training is a crucial element of implementing SEL successfully. Capacity-building in SEL aims to create teaching and socio-emotional aptitude, turning a local teacher, a practitioner of traditional education, into a humanitarian educator. At Better Days, SEL training is mandatory for our teaching staff to better support students in developing the following:

    Emotional Regulation and Emotional Education;
    Social Skills and Social Education;
    Self-understanding, self-esteem, self-conceptualization;
    Brain-building.

SEL is a transformative strategy for education for displaced young people.
Psychosocial Support (PSS)
Our PSS program has been customised for Gekko and is regularly updated to respond to the needs and expectations of our students. On Lesvos, our PSS curriculum included weekly mindfulness sessions to cope with anxiety, social skills groups to work on behaviour and social awareness, circle of girls to talk about gender-related topics, grief support groups to cope with loss, emotional groups to find relief, art therapy for emotional release, psycho-motor therapy to learn about the connection between body and mind, and yoga to release tension, anxiety, stress and Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.
Personalised Education and Individualised Development Plans (IDP)

Some students need more specialised support. Better Days has dedicated resources to accommodate students who require personalised plans and ongoing progress assessments by qualified professionals to help them achieve their goals.

This component was launched in September 2019 with one teacher supporting a group of ten students each. Initially, individual plans were offered to students who require special education or further assistance, such as daily tutoring or psychosocial support, to reach their potential at school. They allowed our educators and PSS staff to work harmoniously to meet student objectives. A personalised approach to education provides students with time and space to learn at their own pace, build on existing skills, and consider their aspirations and plans. In 2021-22, we adapted our approach to providing IDPs to all public education students. An IDP is a document that encourages growth and development by identifying a student’s career and academic objectives and actions and the commitments they need to make to achieve their goals within a three to twelve month period. The students sign this plan. We continuously monitor students’ progress, and plan frequent meetings with the School Counsellor.
